Subject: Application for Data Science Position
Dear KoRo Team,
I am excited to apply for the Data Science position at KoRo. With a Master’s degree in Computational Modeling
and Simulation from TU Dresden and hands-on experience across data analytics, machine learning, and SQL, I am
eager to bring my skills to a purpose-driven and fast-growing company like KoRo.
During my Master’s thesis at Infineon Technologies, I developed predictive maintenance models using LSTM,
Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), and Random Forests on time-series motor control data. This involved
designing data pipelines, extracting features, tuning model parameters, and delivering insights for real-world
engineering applications. In parallel, I worked as a Working Student - Data Scientist at Infineon, where I built
classification models, handled time-series data, and automated ML workflows using Python and Scikit-learn.
Earlier, as a Working Student - Data Analyst at Infineon, I focused on developing dashboards in Tableau, optimizing
SQL-based queries, and improving data processing workflows for internal stakeholders. Additionally, at
Fraunhofer IAIS, I contributed to NLP-focused projects—training small language models and building datasets for
toxicity detection, strengthening my experience in working with varied data types and supporting impactful
applications.
What draws me to KoRo is your innovative approach to food retail and your commitment to transparency,
simplicity, and quality. I’m particularly inspired by the opportunity to work with a diverse team and help optimize
decision-making processes through clear, actionable insights—whether that’s through dashboards, data pipelines,
or ad-hoc analysis. KoRo’s mission resonates strongly with my own values of sustainability, efficiency, and
continuous learning.
I’m currently based in Dresden and would be happy to join the Berlin office regularly. I am excited about
contributing my analytical skills and technical curiosity to KoRo’s data team, while growing with a company that’s
changing how people engage with food.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to support KoRo’s growth with data
that makes a difference.
Warm regards,
Vrushali
